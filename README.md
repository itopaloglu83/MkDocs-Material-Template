In line with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles, every commit to `master` branch is automatically build and deployed to GitHub Pages on `gh-pages` branch with the help of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). For this action to work move `deploy.yml` to `.github/workflows` folder. Non-publishing commits can be made by including `[no ci]` in the commit message.

Please visit [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/MX-Layer/MX-Layer.github.io/tree/gh-pages) in order to see the final product.
